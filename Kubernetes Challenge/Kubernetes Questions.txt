Part 3: Kubernetes Challenge
You’ve been asked to containerize and deploy this API to GCP Kubernetes Engine. 
Provide a written step-by-step guide on how you would build the docker image and deploy this to Kubernetes.
This workload should be able to scale horizontally and serve 100k concurrent users. 
How would you choose:
-Container resource requests and limits
-Probes
-Autoscaler
-Cluster node Instance type

Steps:

Download and install docker/kubernetes
Set up a Dockerfile, which may have references to multiple APIs
set up a script to run docker builds.

Create pods for kubernetes, 
Set up YAML settings for both development and production environments

Create a GCP Kubernetes project
Clone git code onto GCP
run code on GCP
Create App on GCP
deploy as many Apps as needed on GCP



Container Resource Request/Limits. This would depend on the size of each request, and the size of the query. It would also depend on the number of nodes/pods we wanted to run.
In the initial state, I would overestimate the size of each node. Here's a simple estimate:
	Request:
		Memory: 100Mib
		CPU: 500m
	Limit:
		Memory: 500Mib
		CPU: 1000m

Probes:
	We will need an HTTP probe to check whether our pod is live. This will ping a healthz path. Since we're serving requests, this is the most apt probe.

Autoscaler:
	Kubernetes has a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler which we can establish using `kubectl autoscale` as documented here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubectl/kubectl-commands#autoscale.

Cluster Node Instance Type:
Based on google's breakdown for Machine Types, for delivering gaming information, we should be using a C2 Compute Optimized node. However, if this API is supposed to be meant for just general usage
for the public website, or for guides online, a General Purpose E2 node would suffice.
